Here comes the first snow this year. Not in time, but finally it comes.

With a heart full of curiousness, hope, and patience, go on and on, and live the most of it.

- Everything you’ve ever wanted is on the other side of fear.
- “Do you want to be locked into tricycles because they’re easy to learn?” – Douglas Englebart
- Life’s altered you, as it’s altered me. And what would be the point of living if we didn’t let life change us?

Life is like a box of chocolate, what does the next taste like?
